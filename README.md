This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 

> <em>It was created for a challenge given by <b>BeerTech Talents</b>. The main objective of this challenge is to create an application where the customer can access a virtual wallet. In this virtual wallet, the customer can check his balance, take a statement, and transfer amounts to another account.</em>

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

After clone, you should run `yarn` to install all project dependencies.
> Pay attention when you `pull` updates. Sometimes, you'll need to run `yarn` again to install some packages that other developers have installed.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Work in progress

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## src

The `src` folder is where all the content of the application is located.
The `index.tsx` script is our entry point. It is where our `ReactDOM.render()` is called and render our entire application into `#root` element. If you want to rename the id of this element, you should rename it on `public/index.html`.

## assets

Assets folder can be used to put some resources files that our project need. In this folder you can add files such `img`, `scss styles`, `fonts` and so on.  

## components

As the name itself says, its where we put all our components. The pattern of a `component folder` is to have one filed named `index.tsx` and other with the name of component, like `NameOfComponent.tsx`. The main reason to do this way, is to help us developers to know in what file of a specific component I'm working just looking into the tabs. So, the `index.tsx` file will have a default export from the `NameOfComponent.tsx`, which is where all of component code will be located, like in the example below:


```
export { default } from "./NameOfComponent";
```

Following this pattern, we can add specific styles for our components adding a file `NameOfComponent.scss` into the components folder. To read more about it you can jump into [Adding a Stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) section.

## config

Is where we put all configs from libs that we use. 

## context

We use [Context API](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/context.html) (Global state manager) as our global state manager. In this folder is where you can add all providers that you need.

## interfaces

We store all of our `TS` interfaces here. You can find 2 kind of files into this folder following the `I` in the start of files pattern. The first kind of file is `.ts`, which is where we use some `export` that won't work as global, like `enum`. The second example is `.d.ts` files, which we don't need to export de interfaces because the `IDE` and `TS` intellisense will find it by default and suggest it for you.

## screens 

Is where we put our `pages` components. If you look into `routes.tsx` files, it is the components that are rendered right after the routes is called.

## services

We add some services that call backend APIs. In the service files, you can create a `class` and add its methods to make calls and return results. 

## utils

In this folder we add some functions that we can use more than once.

# Installing a Dependency

The generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `yarn`:

```
yarn add <library-name>
```
<br>

# Importing a Component

This project setup supports ES6 modules thanks to Babel.<br>
While you can still use `require()` and `module.exports`, we encourage you to use [`import` and `export`](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) instead.

For example:

### `Button.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    // ...
  }
}

export default Button; // Don’t forget to use export default!
```

### `DangerButton.js`


```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Button from './Button'; // Import a component from another file

class DangerButton extends Component {
  render() {
    return <Button color="red" />;
  }
}

export default DangerButton;
```

Be aware of the [difference between default and named exports](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36795819/react-native-es-6-when-should-i-use-curly-braces-for-import/36796281#36796281). It is a common source of mistakes.

We suggest that you stick to using default imports and exports when a module only exports a single thing (for example, a component). That’s what you get when you use `export default Button` and `import Button from './Button'`.

Named exports are useful for utility modules that export several functions. A module may have at most one default export and as many named exports as you like.

# Adding a Stylesheet

This project setup uses [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) for handling all assets. Node-sass offers a custom way of “extending” the concept of `import` beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a SCSS file, you need to **import the SCSS from the JavaScript file**:

### `Button.scss`

```scss
.Button {
  padding: 20px;
}
```

### `Button.js`

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './Button.scss'; // Tell Webpack that Button.js uses these styles

class Button extends Component {
  render() {
    // You can use them as regular CSS styles
    return <div className="Button" />;
  }
}
```

<br>

# Adding Images and Fonts

With Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.

You can **`import` an image right in a JavaScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that image in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing an image or a font gives you a string value. This value is the final image path you can reference in your code.

Here is an example:

```js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.png'; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image

console.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png

function Header() {
  // Import result is the URL of your image
  return <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />;
}

export default Header;
```

This ensures that when the project is built, Webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.

This works in SCSS too:

```scss
.Logo {
  background-image: url(./logo.png);
}
```
